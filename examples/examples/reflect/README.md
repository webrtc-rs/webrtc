# reflect
reflect demonstrates how with one PeerConnection you can send video to webrtc-rs and have the packets sent back. This example could be easily extended to do server side processing.

## Instructions
### Build reflect
```
cargo build --example reflect
```

### Open reflect example page
[jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/9jgukzt1/) you should see two text-areas and a 'Start Session' button.

### Run reflect, with your browsers SessionDescription as stdin
In the jsfiddle the top textarea is your browser, copy that and:
#### Linux/macOS
Run `echo $BROWSER_SDP | ./target/debug/examples/reflect -a -v`
#### Windows
1. Paste the SessionDescription into a file.
1. Run `./target/debug/examples/reflect -a -v < my_file`

### Input reflect's SessionDescription into your browser
Copy the text that `reflect` just emitted and copy into second text area

### Hit 'Start Session' in jsfiddle, enjoy your video!
Your browser should send video to webrtc-rs, and then it will be relayed right back to you.

Congrats, you have used WebRTC.rs!
