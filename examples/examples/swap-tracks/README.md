# swap-tracks
swap-tracks demonstrates how to swap multiple incoming tracks on a single outgoing track.

## Instructions
### Build swap-tracks
```
cargo build --example swap-tracks
```

### Open swap-tracks example page
[jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/dzc17fga/) you should see two text-areas and a 'Start Session' button.

### Run swap-tracks, with your browsers SessionDescription as stdin
In the jsfiddle the top textarea is your browser, copy that and:
#### Linux/macOS
Run `echo $BROWSER_SDP | ./target/debug/examples/swap-tracks`
#### Windows
1. Paste the SessionDescription into a file.
1. Run `./target/debug/examples/swap-tracks < my_file`

### Input swap-tracks's SessionDescription into your browser
Copy the text that `swap-tracks` just emitted and copy into second text area

### Hit 'Start Session' in jsfiddle, enjoy your video!
Your browser should send streams to webrtc-rs, and then a stream will be relayed back, changing every 5 seconds.

Congrats, you have used WebRTC.rs!
