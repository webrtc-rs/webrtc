# interceptor changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.9.0

* Fix over-NACK due not resetting lost_packets bitmask [\#372](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc/pull/372/).
* Further extended stats interceptors to collect stats for `RemoteOutoundRTPStats` and improve `RemoteInboundRTPStats` collection. [#282](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc/pull/282) by [@k0nserv](https://github.com/k0nserv).
* When generating periodic TWCC feedback packets we no longer burst several packets in a row to catch up, i.e., we now use `MissedTickBehavior::Skip` instead of the default `MissedTickBehavior::Burst` for the ticker in question. [#323](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc/pull/323) by [@k0nserv](https://github.com/k0nserv).
* Don't generate empty TWCC packets that libWebRTC will ignore. [#324](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc/pull/324) by [@k0nserv](https://github.com/k0nserv).
